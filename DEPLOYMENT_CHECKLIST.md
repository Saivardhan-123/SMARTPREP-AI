- [ ] Regular maintenance schedule

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check `package.json` dependencies
   - Verify Node.js version compatibility
   - Check for missing files

2. **Application Crashes**
   - Verify environment variables
   - Check application logs
   - Test locally with same configuration

3. **Database Issues**
   - SQLite files are ephemeral on free tier
   - Consider persistent database for production
   - Check database initialization

4. **Port Issues**
